You run my program using:

python problem9.py

I ran this with Python v3.  It should run on any machine with Python 3.

You then put in the strings you would like to test.  Here are some examples:

(Python3) Keiths-MacBook-Pro:Homework_1 keithjones$ python problem9.py
Give me a string to check: abc@dsu.edu
Your string was accepted.
(Python3) Keiths-MacBook-Pro:Homework_1 keithjones$ python problem9.py
Give me a string to check: abc@pluto.dsu.edu
Your string was accepted.
(Python3) Keiths-MacBook-Pro:Homework_1 keithjones$ python problem9.py
Give me a string to check: 11@123.com
Your string was accepted.
(Python3) Keiths-MacBook-Pro:Homework_1 keithjones$ python problem9.py
Give me a string to check: a.b.ab
You fell out of the DFA.  This string is not accepted.
(Python3) Keiths-MacBook-Pro:Homework_1 keithjones$ python problem9.py
Give me a string to check: ab@ab
Your string was NOT accepted.
(Python3) Keiths-MacBook-Pro:Homework_1 keithjones$ python problem9.py
